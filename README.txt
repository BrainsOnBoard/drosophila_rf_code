This repository contains the code (and required data) for two papers which looked at Drosophila ring neuron receptive fields [1,2].

The relevant code for generating the figures for these papers are in the biosystems2015 and ploscb2017. The utils folder contains code common to both and the data folder contains the necessary data. Note that the data for the papers is not included here, just the code.

Readme files giving more detailed information are dotted around the place.
