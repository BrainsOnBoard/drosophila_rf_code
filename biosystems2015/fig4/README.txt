This folder contains scripts for the perfect memory figure (Figure 4).

To generate the paths, first run biosys_gendata_gensnaps to save the snapshots for each arena. You can then run biosys_gendata_genallpaths to run the simulation. Note that this will take *ages* on a normal computer! If you want to produce test data, try changing the parameters so that fewer simulations are run.
